<p>Iâ€™ve had a blog in some form for many years. This blog is a
continuation of my longest lived professional blog. Most of the articles
were moved from my old domain, neverthenetwork.com (although that domain
had some stuff that was not moved). Iâ€™m particularly excited about this
release because I think Iâ€™ve finally landed on something thatâ€™s truely
simple. Iâ€™ll do a deeper dive in a follow-up post, but this site
effectively works as follows:</p>
<p>Write Markdown -&gt; Run a shell script -&gt; Git Commit/Push</p>
<p>The shell script generates a static site using pandoc and a little
bit of bash. The website looks exactly the same whether behind nginx on
the web or when served locally from my laptop. All I have to do now is
write and I can do my writing in any text editor of my choosing.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve used a few different solutions over the years, in order these
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static HTML</li>
<li>Wordpress</li>
<li>Ghost</li>
<li>Custom Site built on Flask + Flask-Flatpages</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, my favorite solution has been Flask-Flatpages. It allowed
me to write my blog posts in markdown, but then rendered them as HTML at
server start time. This resulted in a mostly nice workflow. Write
Markdown -&gt; Use pandoc to generate a preview -&gt; Push to the
webserver. It wasnâ€™t quite perfect since pandoc and Flask-Flatpages
generated slightly different HTML, but overall this worked really well.
Especially for writing. The use of Flask made it easy to write little
web apps. At the time, I wanted an easy way to get an external view of
<strong>things</strong> on the internet. That way if something was
broken at my day job, I could use my website to see if it was broken
externally as well. I rarely used these tools, but they were fun to
build. In practice I found if I need to do something like this, It was
much more flexible to just use my phone or personal laptop and either my
carrier network or my home network via VPN.</p>
<p>Wordpress and Ghost mostly suffered from the same issue. I greatly
preferred ghost over wordpress. Itâ€™s a simpler solution and I prefer
markdown for focused writing. However, I often ran into situations where
I wanted to write without an internet connection and even when I had an
internet connection, I really didnâ€™t like writing in my web brower. So I
found I would often write markdown locally and then copy and paste the
file into ghost when I was ready to publish.</p>
<p>I had high hopes for Jekyll, but itâ€™s really a bit complicated for my
use-case. While it does allow me to write markdown in an editor, running
it locally is a bit of a pain and unless you run it locally, you canâ€™t
be exactly sure what the article will look like before itâ€™s been pushed.
Also, themes are challenging enough that I canâ€™t be bothered to mess
with them.</p>
